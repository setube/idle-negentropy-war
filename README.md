[点击查看中文版说明 (中文文档)](./README.zh-CN.md)

> A sci-fi incremental/idle game about fighting the entropy of the universe.  

## Game Introduction

**Entropy Reduction War** is a sci-fi idle/incremental game themed around “entropy reduction.” You will lead your civilization from microscopic atomic ordering and molecular cooling to macroscopic stellar extinction and black hole decompression, ultimately achieving energy materialization and universal unification. Fight against the law of increasing entropy and pursue the ultimate order of the universe.

## Features

- **Entropy Reduction Progression**: Manually advance through stages from atomic ordering to universal unification, experiencing the sense of reversing entropy step by step.
- **Civilization Eras**: Each completed entropy reduction stage advances your civilization to a new era (Industrial, Information, Space, Singularity, Ultimate).
- **Tech Tree & Buildings**: Unlock and upgrade technologies and buildings corresponding to each entropy stage to boost resource production and entropy reduction efficiency.
- **Resource Management**: Manage multiple resources such as energy, matter, dark matter, antimatter, nanomaterials, and more.
- **Events & Traits**: Face cosmic disasters, technological breakthroughs, and choose civilization traits for unique bonuses.
- **Dark Forest Law**: Excessive coordinate exposure will trigger dimensional strikes—develop with caution!

## How to Play

1. **Manual Entropy Reduction**: Click the “Reduce Entropy” button to consume resources and advance the current entropy stage.
2. **Build Structures**: Construct and upgrade buildings for the current stage to increase resource output and entropy reduction efficiency.
3. **Unlock Technologies**: Unlock technologies related to the current stage for new abilities and higher efficiency.
4. **Advance Eras**: Each completed entropy stage automatically advances to the next civilization era, unlocking new content.
5. **Manage Threats**: Monitor coordinate exposure and three-body deviation to prevent civilization collapse.

## Main Systems

- **Entropy Stages**: Atomic Ordering → Molecular Cooling → Stellar Extinction → Black Hole Decompression → Energy Materialization → Universal Unification
- **Civilization Eras**: Industrial → Information → Space → Singularity → Ultimate
- **Resource Types**: Energy, Matter, Dark Matter, Antimatter, Nanomaterials, Quantum Bits, Civilization Genes, etc.
- **Tech & Buildings**: Each stage has exclusive technologies and buildings to support entropy reduction.

## Tech Stack

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management
- [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/) UI component library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the frontend build tool
